# webRPG
WebRPG is a vanilla Javascript RPG engine (Ok, one line of JQuery). Some would say abandoned, I would say lovingly retired. 

I wanted to focus on things other than responsive design, so it's hard locked to 1920x1080 resolution.

I learned a lot about the details and frustrations of event listeners, the strange behavior of Javascript classes, such as they are, and writing performant functions.
