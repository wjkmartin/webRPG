# webRPG
WebRPG is a vanilla Javascript RPG engine that I wrote while learning the language. The code quality is just ok - but I've left it up because there's some cool bits.

I learned a lot about the details and frustrations of event listeners, the strange behavior of Javascript classes, such as they are, and writing performant functions.

I wanted to focus on things other than responsive design, so it's hard locked to 1920x1080 resolution.

If you like the idea of this, I'm currently working on a different but similar project, [Fantasy Quest 2](https://github.com/wjkmartin/fantasy-quest-2) which is a React / Redux based game engine (but mostly just a game at this point).
